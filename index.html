                    Our goal has <a href="http://blog.ohheyworld.com/the-story-behind-the-original-idea-of-oh-hey-world/">always been</a> to connect people in meaningful ways in person. Truly making community accessible everywhere, for everyone (nothing like a bold mission, right?). Oh Hey World's location sharing platform -- best thought of as Foursquare at the city level -- was our first attempt.</p>
                    <p>We learned a lot building that 1st product, much of which is outlined in <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2013/10/12/a-tech-startup-recap-12-months-in/">this 12 month recap on PandoDaily</a>. Like so many entrepreneurs, we overbuilt. An easier way to share your arrival in a new city is not a pain point for anyone outside of the long term traveler segment. Further, delivering on the value proposition of finding nearby friends &amp; like minded people is only viable with massive scale of users &mdash; OHW simply was not a strong enough hook to get to scale.</p>
                    <p>Oh Hey World was <a href="http://blog.ohheyworld.com/mobile-web-startup-oh-hey-world-streamlines-the-travel-experience-from-the-moment-of-arrival/">released in beta in March of 2013</a>, and attracted over 2,500 users prior to being shut down in 2017. Our <a href="http://blog.ohheyworld.com/the-almost-eulogy-of-oh-hey-world/"><em>almost</em> eulogy was published</a> in July of 2016, and the final plug was pulled in May of 2017.</p>
